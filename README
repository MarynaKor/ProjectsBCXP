Now we need to run maven clean and install first.
Make a snapshot, with this you should be able to build the image of the project 
as soon as the image is done you can start the builder
-- docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml build

and now run the compose file

-- docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up

Next To-Do's
- create a field "starting date" for Projects -- done
- create a field for how many days it is running
- also create new Entity Person
- combine those two
- copy the nginx from the SpringApp and test it if it works on yours...
